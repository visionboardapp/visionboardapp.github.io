<br>Last updated: October 12, 2021
<p>
    Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the mobile application Vision Board (the "Service") operated by Olya Yunakova ("us", "we", or "our").
    Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.
    By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.
</p>
<b>Subscriptions</b>
<p>
    Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.
    At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Monkey Taps Inc cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your iTunes account management page or by contacting Apple, Inc customer support team.
</p>
<b>Fee Changes</b>
<p>
    We, in our sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
    We will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
    Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.  
</p>
<b>Refunds</b>
<p>
    Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.
</p>

    Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("Content"). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.
    By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours (you own it) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.
